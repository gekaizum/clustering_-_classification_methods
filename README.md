Implementation of clustering algoritms in matlab


1. First, run the file "unsupervized_learning0.m".
   It will create and save 24 different topologies of gaussian clusters of points. (4 topologies for different dimensions from 2 to 6).
   Parameters such: number of clusters in each topology, maximum dimension size, mean value and variance for point generator - can be configured in this file.
2. Now you can run any other file. Each file contains different clustering algorithms, explanations can be found into the code.
3. When you want to build a new topologies delete all variables in Matlab environment before for correct work of creation process.
